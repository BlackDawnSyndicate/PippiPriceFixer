# PippiPriceFixer

## Description

Pippi Price Fixer is a tool designed to calculate and adjust item prices in the game Conan Exiles, based on a variety of factors such as rarity, demand, and source distance as part of the Pippi Mod's 'Economy' functionality.. This tool aims to help players create a more balanced and immersive economy within the game and allow trading as a profitable endeavour. This tool is in Alpha and has not been extensively tested. No doubt you WILL run into economy-breaking price suggestions on part of the tool, and you, as admin, will need to make gudgement calls on where it is prudent to adjust the prices. This is not a 'Price Bible,' but will, hopefully, serve to provide some guidance in an otherwise totally arbitrary economy.
